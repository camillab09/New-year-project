<b>Happy new year!</b>
<br>
For my new year project I decided to create a simple weather app. The app can be used by travellers, and is easily accessible via smartphone, which allows the user to quickly check the weather in the city of their choice.<br><br>
The app takes a city and displays the current temperature, weather and expected high/low temps for the day. The app also gives the current day based on an array. <br><br>
To get the app to work as intended, I followed a few different tutorials, and used the API from Openweathermap.org. This allowed me to collect specific points of information and use them to manipulate my website. <br><br>
I also decided to add function to allow both keypress (enter) as well as the onclick button to display the search results, and the background image changes based on different temperatures. For now I've only added three different images- one for temperatures below 0C, for above 10C and one default. This can easily be amended in the future to add more variants.
<br><br>
I hope you like it!
